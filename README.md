# String-Manupulation-using-Python
In Python, a string is a sequence of characters. Strings are immutable, which means that you cannot change a string once it has been created.

You can create a string in Python by enclosing a sequence of characters in single or double quotes. 
you can manipulate strings using various methods and operations. For example, you can concatenate two strings using the + operator, or you can access individual characters in a string using indexing.
You can find more information about string manipulation in Python in my previous response.
There are many ways to manipulate strings in Python. Here are a few common operations:
Concatenation: You can concatenate two strings using the + operator
Indexing: You can access individual characters in a string using indexing
Slicing: You can slice a string to get a substring
Formatting: You can use the 'format()' method to insert values into a string
Replacing: You can use the 'replace()' method to replace a substring with another string. These are just a few examples of string manipulation in Python.
